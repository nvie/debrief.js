## This library is no longer maintained!

If you're reading this, you likely use debrief.js in combination with [`decoders`](https://decoders.cc/). In `decoders` >= 2.0, `debrief` is no longer a dependency, and there is no further wide-spread use of it. I've archived the repo to make clear it's no longer maintained.
