v0.2.0
------
**Breaking changes:** 

- Dropped support for annotating object keys

**New features:**

- Add new serializers optimized for web/JSON output.
  * For full inline annotated objects, use `serialize()`
  * For less verbose output (a list of errors and their locations, not the
    entire data structure echoed back), use `summarize()`
